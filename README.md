Hello. My name is Hanna Van Ness. I am a Junior majoring in Business Analytics at the University of Iowa. I am pursuing a job as a sports or business analyst. Data and analytics intrigues me becuase they allow you to dive deeper into metrics, while allowing companies to be more efficient/effective.
